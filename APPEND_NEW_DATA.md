## Instruction to add new data into database that has data

ATTENTION:

 > Make one backup of the database before continue.
 > If the database has data that you want to process again, you need remove old data from database using SQL manually. (Look the clean-existing-data.sql to get an example.)

1 - Put your new shapefiles into raw-data-processing/dir/ directory following the existing structure;

    - The name of shapefile must to following the pattern: prodes_<the biome name or legal amazon>_deforestation_d<year> (Ex.: prodes_amazon_deforestation_d2019)
    - If you want change this, edit the scripts into features directory.

2 - Check the "main.sh" script setting to ensure the correct flow. Only enable the DATA="YES" and FEATURES="YES" otherwise the scripts will delete your data;

3 - If new data is related to new periods not yet defined in the period table, so, you must insert this periods before processing these data;

See in the metadata.sql file to learn how to proceed with ids, example:
 > INSERT INTO public.period(id, id_data, start_date, end_date) VALUES (31, 2, '2018-08-01', '2019-07-31');

4 - Edit the scripts inside features directory, related with your target data type, changing the parameters of start_date, end_date and years;

5 - Check the database configurations into pg_config.sh to ensure the connection string is ok;

OK, now you are ready to run the main script run_all.sh to proccessing the new data.

6 - After all the data has been imported into the database and the intersections with the LOIs have been processed,
the next step is to export to JSON files using the data-feeder; therefore, access the deforestation-data-feeder
project and read the instructions for doing so.
